Title: Research

I have broad interests in the history of seventeenth and eighteenth
century European philosophy, though my work to date mostly focuses on
Immanuel Kant's philosophy. I have written on Kant's views concerning
the mind, perception, his theory of human reason and rationality, and
the broader metaphysical and epistemological views with which these
ideas are integrated. I'm also very interested in seeing what, if any,
connections may be made between Kant's positions and contemporary
research programs in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics. In
particular, I am interested in issues pertaining to the study of mental
content, the nature and significance of self-consciousness, reasoning
and rationality, and animal cognition.
