I have broad interests in epistemology, metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, and
the foundations of cognitive science. I pursue these interests historically, by
querying the European philosophical tradition from the seventeenth through the
nineteenth centuries. I am particularly interested in German Idealism, and the
focus of my work thus far has been Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s philosophy, especially his
views on the nature of the mind and the forms of its manifestation, both
rational and non-rational, in animal life. I have written on Kant&rsquo;s views
concerning the mind, perception, his theory of human reason and rationality, and
the broader metaphysical and epistemological views with which these ideas are
integrated. I&rsquo;m also very interested in seeing what, if any, connections may be
made between Kant&rsquo;s positions and contemporary research programs in the
philosophy of mind and metaphysics. In particular, I am interested in issues
pertaining to explanation, the study of mental content, the nature and
significance of self-consciousness, reasoning and rationality, and animal
cognition.
