I have broad interests in epistemology, metaphysics, the philosophy of
mind, and the foundations of cognitive science. I pursue these interests
historically, by querying the European philosophical tradition from the
seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries. The focus of my work thus
far has been Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s philosophy, particularly his views on the
nature of the mind and the forms of its manifestation, both rational and
non-rational, in animal life. I have written on Kant&rsquo;s views concerning
the mind, perception, his theory of human reason and rationality, and
the broader metaphysical and epistemological views with which these
ideas are integrated. I&rsquo;m also very interested in seeing what, if any,
connections may be made between Kant&rsquo;s positions and contemporary
research programs in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics. In
particular, I am interested in issues pertaining to explanation, the
study of mental content, the nature and significance of
self-consciousness, reasoning and rationality, and animal cognition.
