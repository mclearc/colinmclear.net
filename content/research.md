I have broad interests in epistemology, metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, and the
foundations of cognitive science. I pursue these interests historically, by querying
the European philosophical tradition from the seventeenth through the nineteenth
centuries. The focus of my work thus far has been Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s philosophy,
particularly his views on the nature of the mind and the forms of its manifestation,
both rational and non-rational, in animal life. I have written on Kant&rsquo;s views
concerning the mind, perception, his theory of human reason and rationality, and the
broader metaphysical and epistemological views with which these ideas are integrated.
I&rsquo;m also very interested in seeing what, if any, connections may be made between
Kant&rsquo;s positions and contemporary research programs in the philosophy of mind and
metaphysics. In particular, I am interested in issues pertaining to the study of
mental content, the nature and significance of self-consciousness, reasoning and
rationality, and animal cognition.
