I have broad interests in the philosophy of mind and the foundations of cognitive
science, as well as the history of European Modern philosophy from the seventeenth
through the nineteenth centuries. My published work to date mostly focuses on the
philosophy of Immanuel Kant. I have written on Kant&rsquo;s views concerning the mind,
perception, his theory of human reason and rationality, and the broader metaphysical
and epistemological views with which these ideas are integrated. I&rsquo;m also very
interested in seeing what, if any, connections may be made between Kant&rsquo;s positions
and contemporary research programs in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics. In
particular, I am interested in issues pertaining to the study of mental content, the
nature and significance of self-consciousness, reasoning and rationality, and animal
cognition.
