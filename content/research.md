I have broad interests in epistemology, metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, and the
foundations of cognitive science. I pursue these interests historically, primarily
through querying the European philosophical tradition from the seventeenth through
the nineteenth centuries. The particular focus of my work thus far has been on the
nature of the mind and the various forms of its manifestation, both rational and
non-rational, in animal life. My published work to date mostly focuses on the
philosophy of Immanuel Kant. I have written on Kant&rsquo;s views concerning the mind,
perception, his theory of human reason and rationality, and the broader metaphysical
and epistemological views with which these ideas are integrated. I&rsquo;m also very
interested in seeing what, if any, connections may be made between Kant&rsquo;s positions
and contemporary research programs in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics. In
particular, I am interested in issues pertaining to the study of mental content, the
nature and significance of self-consciousness, reasoning and rationality, and animal
cognition.
