I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Philosophy](http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/) at the University
of Nebraska-Lincoln. My work focuses on two (often intersecting) areas of
philosophy -- the History of Modern Philosophy (especially Kant) and the
Philosophy of Mind. Here you&rsquo;ll find links to my [research](/research) and [teaching](/teaching), as
well as the occasional [blog post](/posts).

If you&rsquo;re interested, here&rsquo;s my complete CV: [PDF](/materials/McLearCV.pdf) | [HTML](/materials/McLearCV.html).

I have broad interests in the philosophy of mind and the foundations of cognitive
science, as well as the history of European Modern philosophy from the seventeenth
through the nineteenth centuries. My published work to date mostly focuses on the
philosophy of Immanuel Kant. I have written on Kant&rsquo;s views concerning the mind,
perception, his theory of human reason and rationality, and the broader metaphysical
and epistemological views with which these ideas are integrated. I&rsquo;m also very
interested in seeing what, if any, connections may be made between Kant&rsquo;s positions
and contemporary research programs in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics. In
particular, I am interested in issues pertaining to the study of mental content, the
nature and significance of self-consciousness, reasoning and rationality, and animal
cognition.

#### <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Moving to Hugo {#moving-to-hugo}

    EXPORT_FILE_NAME: moving-to-hugo

Another summer, another excuse to tinker with my website. I&rsquo;ve used [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com), a
python [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web%5Ftemplate%5Fsystem#Static%5Fsite%5Fgenerators), to run this website for nearly six years. It&rsquo;s a
great tool. But I dislike python [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency%5Fhell), and pelican is a bit slow.
So I&rsquo;ve looked elsewhere. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is blazing fast, has a thriving community,
decent templates, and a downloadable binary that you can get via [homebrew](https://brew.sh). No
more dependency management! Also important for me (as an [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user), there is
a great [org-mode](https://orgmode.org) exporter---[ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.netlify.com)---that lets me easily generate the web
content from an org-file. On the whole I&rsquo;ve been very happy with the move.

I&rsquo;ve also changed hosting from github to [Netlify](https://netlify.com), which provides dead-simple
hosting. All you do is point it at a git repository (which remains on [Github](https://github.com/mclearc))
and tell it what commands to run and it provides continuous deployment. So
whenever I make a change to the site and push that change to [my repository](https://github.com/mclearc/colinmclear.net) on
Github Netlify automatically regenerates the site. Very cool. Plus, easy https
for a more secure site.


#### <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Maintaining a CV in Multiple Formats {#maintaining-a-cv-in-multiple-formats}

    EXPORT_FILE_NAME: maintaining-cv-multiple-formats

    EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :aliases /2015/maintaining-a-cv-in-multiple-formats :type post :toc false

Suppose you want to keep a CV accessible in PDF, html, and perhaps other
formats (e.g. docx). It&rsquo;s a pain to do them all individually and keep them in
sync. Here&rsquo;s one way to avoid that issue, though it has a bit of initial work
involved in setting everything up. What you want to do is keep your CV (or
really anything of that ilk that you want to have available in multiple
formats) in a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file and then use
[pandoc](http://pandoc.org) to convert the YAML file into whatever documents
you need. I got the idea from looking at
[this template](https://github.com/mrzool/cv-boilerplate) on Github.

What you want to do is keep the CV info in a YAML file like so:

```text
name: Immanuel Kant
address: Königsberg, Prussia
email: manny@copernicanrevolution.edu

AOS:
- Aesthetics, Epistemology, Ethics, Metaphysics, Philosophy of Mind, Political Philosophy

AOC:
- German Idealism, Philosophy of Religion

experience:
- years: 1770-1804
  employer: University of Königsberg
  job: Chair of Logic and Metaphysics
  city: Königsberg, DE
```

Using pandoc, you can then convert this into a variety of formats,
including HTML and PDF. The key is to create a template for every output
format that you need. For example, you might template your employment
history like so:

```text
$for(experience)$
  $experience.years$\\
  \textsc{$experience.employer$}\\
  \emph{$experience.job$}\\
  $experience.city$\\[.2cm]
$endfor$
```

Pandoc then feeds the YAML info to LaTeX for PDF typesetting. You can
see a sample [here](materials/images/preview.jpg).

With this method, you can keep your entire CV in a single YAML file and
easily generate a PDF, HTML, or some other format. For the full set of
templates for LaTeX and HTML, along with a `makefile` for easy
conversion, you can look at
[my repo](https://github.com/mclearc/cv-boilerplate.git) on Github.

    EXPORT_FILE_NAME: pandocletter

I had to write a recommendation letter today and thought I&rsquo;d use it as an
excuse to write up a Pandoc template for Pandoc-LaTeX conversion. It generates
a nice looking letter with letterhead (assuming you have a logo for it). It
uses the [newlfm package](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/newlfm?lang=en). The template is on github [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mclearc/pandoc-templates/master/letter.tex). I got the idea from
Matthew Miller&rsquo;s [post](http://www.matthewjmiller.net/howtos/customized-cover-letter-scripts/), and [this discussion](http://texblog.org/2013/11/11/latexs-alternative-letter-class-newlfm/) on [texblog.org](http://texblog.org).

#### <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Text Editors and Academic Writing {#text-editors-and-academic-writing}

    EXPORT_DATE: 2016-09-05

    EXPORT_FILE_NAME: texteditor

    EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :aliases /2016/text-editors-and-academic-writing :type post :toc false

Tools for writing using a computer fall into two broad camps. On the one side
we have [WYSIWIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) word processing applications like Microsoft Word, Apple Pages,
and Google Docs. They allow not only the typing of text but also real-time
formatting and display. These applications are familiar to most, and are the
dominant ones used in higher-ed today. They also tend to be expensive (or
available only to those with institutional affiliation), suffer from issues of
feature-bloat and unnecessary make-overs, and use proprietary
non-human-readable file formats.

In contrast to the WYSIWIG editors stands the [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text%5Feditor). It operates on
plain text, human readable, files. And its main purpose is to parse text in
the most efficient way possible. It does not (typically) display a page as it
will look when printed. There are many, many text editors one can choose from
them, and the two most well-known---[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [vim](http://www.vim.org)---are free.

As far as I can tell there are basically three main reasons to prefer a
text editor over a word processing application.

-   Text editors are more efficient at editing text
-   Text editors connect better with other research and writing tools
-   Text editors are easier to enjoy working in/with

I&rsquo;m not sure that I find any of these or the [many other various arguments](https://www.google.com/search?q=writing+in+plain+text) for
writing in plain text with a text editor totally convincing, at least in
isolation. Certainly there is no one-size-fits-all answer. If you like writing
in MS Word or Apple Pages, if such programs help you get on with writing, then
great.

That said, there are some really useful things that you can do when writing in
plain text and using a powerful (and often free) text editor, or command line
tools made for manipulating text (like [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%5F(Unix)), [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) or [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed)). Here are a few
reasons that I find compelling. I&rsquo;m sure there are others.

1.  Search

    Whether searching in a single file or across files, when writing in plain
    text it is really quite simple to perform searches looking for a particular
    word or combination of words. If you know the syntax for writing [regular
    expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular%5Fexpression) the process is even easier. For example, from a directory of
    notes I can search for the occurrence of particular words or phrases and
    then move to each occurrence (even if they are in separate files)
    seamlessly, all using just a text editor ([emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)) and a simple search
    command (in this case using emacs to [interface](https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el) with a search program called
    the [silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the%5Fsilver%5Fsearcher) or &ldquo;ag&rdquo;).

2.  Version control

    I&rsquo;ve [written before](%7Bfilename%7D/blog/VersionControl.md)
    about how useful it is to have your writing under some sort of
    version control. Most modern text editors allow you to directly and
    easily interface with the vc of your choice in the course of an
    editing session. In the case of emacs there is the incomparable
    [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit).

3.  Outlining & Notetaking

    Since their main use is manipulating text, text editors are unsurprisingly
    great for outlining and notetakeing. For example, Vim has a great outlining
    tool called [Voom](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script%5Fid=2657) and emacs has the incomparable [org-mode](http://orgmode.org). You can even use
    org-mode for keeping a [research wiki](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26669280/setup-a-personal-wiki-in-emacs-org-mode) if that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re thing. You can see a
    historian making use of vim&rsquo;s notetaking powers [here](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/plain-text-citations.html).

4.  Flexibility

    Do you spend a lot of time on your computer at night and wish MS Word
    wasn&rsquo;t such a blaringly bright white application to work with? Do you wish
    you could automate or create keyboard shortcuts for repetitive tasks during
    editing? At least with the three major open source editors---[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vim](http://www.vim.org),
    and [atom](https://atom.io)---this is relatively easy to do (or to learn to do). You can
    change how your editor looks, what kind of keyboard combinations do what,
    and automate simple (or even [complex](http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-15-macros/#.V8sXlTuMCYU)) tasks.

5.  Interface with other programs

    Though this connects with the second bullet point above, it is useful to
    emphasize. For example, I use [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) for converting all my academic writing
    and teaching materials. I also keep all my bibliographic material in a
    [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org) document. My text editor has plug-ins which allow me to seamlessly
    interact with these programs and others, without having to leave the
    editor. I&rsquo;m also able to do all the upkeep for my various websites within
    the editor. I&rsquo;ve found this kind of uniform interface for everything to be
    extremely useful.

So try a text editor (or two or three) and see what you think (but really, use
[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)). Write your next paper in it (or at least the notes for it) and see if
you find it helpful. There is always a [learning curve](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/curves.jpg) to take into account.
But after you get the hang of a particular editor you can decide whether it is
really a help or if you&rsquo;d rather just chuck it and go back to MS Word, Pages,
or [whatever worked for you](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) before.


#### <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Version Control and Academic Writing {#version-control-and-academic-writing}

Academic writing typically requires writing something in drafts. Many drafts.
Until recently there have been few ways of elegantly handling this. Often, one
would need to title the current draft with the day&rsquo;s date, then save this
draft in a folder (named, e.g., &ldquo;drafts&rdquo; or &ldquo;versions&rdquo;), and do this every
time one sits down to write. This works, in some ways. The data is there. The
problem is that you quickly end up with a folder (or desktop&rsquo;s) worth of
files. These filenames have typically ridiculous and increasingly obscure
titles (e.g. final-draft-final-revision\final-draft-04-2018.docx). And it
is seldom clear, using this method, exactly what one did when, without
actually opening a particular file and looking, or trying to remember when
(and where) it was that one made the relevant change.

Nowadays, especially if you use some sort of cloud-based word-processor, it&rsquo;s
likely that you have access to various ways of looking at your version
history. For example, Google docs has a [revision history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en) option (something
similar exists for [Dropbox](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/516), which lets you easily move back and forth among
different versions. Revision histories of this kind offer a way to
automatically back up one&rsquo;s writing. This is especially helpful if you&rsquo;re not
the type of person to carefully name each day&rsquo;s writing with a new time/date
stamp and save them all in the appropriate folder. There are also service (as
opposed to application) specific ways of tracking changes to a file. At least
[some](http://versionrocket.com) of [them](http://versionrocket.com) allow you to compare differences between versions of files. But
at least two things are missing. First, there is no straightforward way of
seeing what has changed where, and to see this at arbitrary levels of
granularity. Second, in order to see what&rsquo;s changed when, you have to look in
the document itself. There is no general log of the changes you&rsquo;ve made to the
file.

Here&rsquo;s what I have in mind:

{{< figure src="/materials/images/ScreenShot52964.png" caption="Figure 1: Change Log" >}}

You see here a series of entries going back over two years, with a description
of what I took to be the most important changes at the time. I can then open
any one of the those entries and see a more detailed, line by line,
description of changes. This is called a &ldquo;diff&rdquo;. I can also roll back the
version of the file I&rsquo;m working on to any of these changes. Each &ldquo;commit&rdquo; is a
snapshot of the relevant files at the time, which I can retrieve at any point.

I think this is a really nice way to track and visualize one&rsquo;s progress on
some piece of writing. This is hard to do with standard word processors and
their means of versioning, but very straightforward to do with a more
sophisticated kind of [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision%5Fcontrol). A version control system can
manage changes to a file at an extremely fine level of grain--down to a line
or character if necessary. While this system was originally adopted by
programmers, it can also be very useful in academic writing (or really any
writing where multiple drafts are created).

This form of version control pictured above depends on a system called
[Git](https://git-scm.com).[^fn:1] There are lots of [tutorials](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) and [other resources](https://www.atlassian.com/git/) for using Git.
Though Git is often used from the command line there are also some [great](http://gitup.co) free
[graphical interfaces](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) for Git. There are also a lot of helpful [discussions](http://writers.stackexchange.com/questions/10440/what-is-the-purpose-of-version-control/10443#10443)
online concerning writing while using a version control system like Git.

The basic idea is that, using whatever writing application one likes,
one tracks changes to a document, or a whole directory of documents
(e.g. adding image files for presentations, or additional parts of a
document kept in separate files when writing longer works like a thesis
or novel). The changes can be tracked at an arbitrary level of grain--to
the sentence, word, or character--and different versions can be easily
compared. All of this can be done without generating lots of files with
different numbers or date/time stamps. Everything is kept in a database
that one can easily interact with using either the command line or some
form of graphical interface.

So far, this isn&rsquo;t necessarily any different from what one can do using
Word or Google Docs. One additional benefit of using a version control
system is that one can easily label and describe batches of changes
(e.g. revisions to a particular section of a paper or chapter) and keep
a single record of these changes. Then, if one want to look back at
one&rsquo;s progress, or for a specific change that one made, all one need do
is look at the single general document listing the changes. You can even
do this in the text editor of your choice (e.g. vim or sublime text)

For example, here&rsquo;s a sample log of the changes made to a paper I&rsquo;ve been
working on, using a vim plugin called &ldquo;[gitv](https://github.com/gregsexton/gitv)&rdquo;, which depends on Tim Pope&rsquo;s
[fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) plugin ([SublimeGit](https://sublimegit.net) is an equally excellent sublime text plugin).

{{< figure src="/materials/images/ScreenShot56089.png" >}}

On the left is the git log of changes. On the right is a more detailed
description of what changed--what was added, deleted, or moved.


##### Using Git {#using-git}

The basic workflow for using Git is as follows. In the directory you&rsquo;re
keeping your project in (you do keep this in a directory and not just on
your desktop right?) you need to create a Git repository. This means
typing `git init` on the command line from the directory, or doing so
via whatever GUI app you&rsquo;ve picked. You only have to do this once per
writing project. So that&rsquo;s:

-   `cd \path\to\repository`
-   `git init`
-   `git add filename.file`
-   `git commit`
    -   write commit message
    -   write and quit file

Once you&rsquo;ve got your repository (or &ldquo;repo&rdquo;) you need to add files for
tracking. Just type `git add` and the name of the file you&rsquo;re tracking.
Then type `git commit`. You&rsquo;ll then type a commit message to go along
with the commit--e.g. &ldquo;first commit&rdquo;. Write and quit, or press commit in
whatever application you&rsquo;re using. At this point you&rsquo;ve got a
functioning version control system. So your workflow should be something
like the following:

-   Write
-   Add/stage changes
-   Write commit message and commit

There&rsquo;s a lot to Git that I can&rsquo;t cover here. It can be very helpful when
experimenting with an idea. It&rsquo;s also a nice way to think about and track your
work over time. One downside of using a system like git is that it doesn&rsquo;t
work well with Microsoft Word or other rich text WYSIWIG text editors. But
there are ways [around](http://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/25/using-microsoft-word-with-git/) [this](https://www.martineve.com/2013/08/18/using-git-in-my-writing-workflow/).

If you like the idea of git, commit messages, and a readable log of changes
you&rsquo;ve made to a file, but don&rsquo;t want to deal with the more technical aspects
of setting up git and using it, there are also great web apps like [Penflip](https://www.penflip.com),
which streamline much of the process.


#### <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Writing a syllabus for multiple formats {#writing-a-syllabus-for-multiple-formats}

    EXPORT_DATE: 2016-07-17

    EXPORT_FILE_NAME: syllabus_yaml

I find it generally preferable to keep information I use for teaching in a
format that allows for different styles of presentation. I&rsquo;ve written [before](http://colinmclear.net/2015/maintaining-a-cv-in-multiple-formats)
about how one might keep a CV in a yaml document that outputs to a variety of
different possible formats using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/README.html). I also use a similar system for
syllabi.

The basic idea is to keep your syllabus in a yaml file and export it to html,
pdf, or rtf using a makefile. The nice thing about this is that you can, e.g.,
hand out a nicely formatted PDF (or printout) of your syllabus at the
beginning of the semester, and then keep a continually updated version on your
course website as HTML, all without having to have multiple documents that
you&rsquo;re editing. You can find the basic template on [Github](https://github.com/mclear-teaching-projects/syllabus%5Ftemplate) and an example from
my [PHIL 101 class](http://phil101.colinmclear.net), also on [Github](https://github.com/mclear-teaching-projects/phil101/tree/master/Syllabus%5FIntro).

The html and latex templates are pretty basic, but serviceable. You should be
able to easily modify them to fit your particular needs.

    EXPORT_DATE: 2015-08-05

    EXPORT_FILE_NAME: reference-management

There are two things I wish I had better habits for in grad
school---note taking, and managing references. I&rsquo;ll touch on them both
here, but I&rsquo;m mainly going to focus on managing references.

I read a lot, and I skim even more. I want a tool that will help me do
three things. First, I want to be able to keep track of what I&rsquo;m
reading, preferably across multiple devices (e.g. an ipad and a laptop).
This is easy if you read one thing at a time, and never start reading
anything else until you&rsquo;ve finished the previous item. But I don&rsquo;t work
that way---perhaps the Internet has caused my short attention span. I&rsquo;m
usually reading several things at once, and often circle back around to
one thing after I&rsquo;ve started something else.

Second, I want to be able to keep track of notes concerning what I&rsquo;m
reading. This is easily done in the margins (if you&rsquo;re not working
electronically, as I almost always am) or in a notebook. But these are
data silos. I want something that I can easily get data out of later.

Third, I want to be able to easily cite what I&rsquo;ve read in my writing.
So, I want three things---reading, annotation, and citation management.
