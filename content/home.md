I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Philosophy](http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/) at the University
of Nebraska-Lincoln. My work focuses on two (often intersecting) areas of
philosophy -- the History of Modern Philosophy (especially Kant) and the
Philosophy of Mind. Here you&rsquo;ll find links to my [research](/research) and [teaching](/teaching), as
well as the occasional [blog post](/posts).

If you&rsquo;re interested, here&rsquo;s my complete CV: [PDF](/materials/McLearCV.pdf) | [HTML](/materials/McLearCV.html).
